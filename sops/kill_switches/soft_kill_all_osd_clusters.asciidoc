== Description
This SOP outlines how to soft kill all data plane OSD clusters, the existing Kafka instances will remain active until they expire.

== Prerequisites
1. You have the `/teams/managed-services/roles/dev.yml` role added to your user in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/data/teams/managed-services/users[app-interface]. This is required to access the kas-fleet-manager dashboards and namespace.
** For example: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/teams/managed-services/users/dffrench.yml[dffrench.yml]
2. Fork the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface[app-interface] repository and add the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/devtools-bot[devtools-bot] user as a Maintainer of your fork.

== Execute/Resolution
1. Update the `KAFKA_CAPACITY_MAX_CAPACITY` property to `0` under the `managed-services-production.yml` namespace parameters of the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-services/cicd/saas/saas-kas-fleet-manager.yaml[kas-fleet-manager saas file].
2. Open an MR and contact one of the approvers listed by the @devtools-bot.
3. Contact the Incident Commanders, as per https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MyWj_V5QCFVHDjedo2OMeikslcMrf74nBC-kIATOh84/edit#, asking for the Status Page to be updated to say the Service is no longer available
