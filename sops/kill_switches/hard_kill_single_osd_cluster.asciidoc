= Hard kill single OSD cluster

toc::[]

== Description
This SOP outlines how to immediately remove a single data plane OSD cluster.

== Prerequisites
1. Fork the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface[app-interface] repository and add the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/devtools-bot[devtools-bot] user as a Maintainer of your fork.
2. Logged in as a user in the `Red Hat Kafka Service Fleet Manager` organisation (external_id of `14410147`) in OCM production. To verify you are logged in as a user in this org, run `ocm whoami | grep 14410147` and verify the external_id is shown.

== Execute/Resolution
1. Update the `schedulable` property to `false` for the specific OSD cluster in `CLUSTER_LIST` under the `managed-services-production.yml` namespace parameters of the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-services/cicd/saas/saas-kas-fleet-manager.yaml[kas-fleet-manager saas file]
2. Open an MR and contact one of the approvers listed by the @devtools-bot.
3. Log in to the https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OCM UI] and select the specific OSD cluster.
4. Hibernate the cluster from the actions drop down.
5. Contact the Incident Commanders, as per https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MyWj_V5QCFVHDjedo2OMeikslcMrf74nBC-kIATOh84/edit#, asking for the Status Page to be updated to say the Service is no longer available

*Execute 48 hours after the above steps*

1. After 48 hours, unhibernate the OSD cluster, otherwise Kafkas will not be deleted.
2. Once zero Kafka instances remain in any state from the https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/d/WLBv_KuMz/kas-fleet-manager-metrics?orgId=1[Kas Fleet Manager metrics dashboard], proceed to the next step.
3. Remove the specific cluster from the `CLUSTER_LIST` under the `managed-services-production.yml` namespace parameters of the https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-services/cicd/saas/saas-kas-fleet-manager.yaml[kas-fleet-manager saas file].
4. Open an MR and contact one of the approvers listed by the @devtools-bot.

== Validate
1. Validate you can no longer log in to the specific OSD cluster.

== Troubleshooting
=== Hibernation taking longer than expected
1. Contact SRE-P through the `sd-sre-platform` slack channel.
