= Creating users in MAS-SSO for Data Plane OSD cluster

toc::[]

== Description

The purpose of this SOP is to describe the process of creating users in MAS-SSO for Data Plane OSD cluster access. 


== Prerequisites

You will need access to the following:

* mas_kafka_sre realm in MAS-SSO
* OCM credentials to be the user of the data plane cluster
* Access to the URL doc in the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TtO6wLd1lz0XjYqOBjP9kgYFbOIXZDFlM_eib4H2egw/edit#[RTS] getting started guide


== Execute/Resolution
=== Creating the user in SSO
1. Login into MAS SSO using the credentials from the URL doc in the RTS getting started guide
2. Navigate to the mas_kafka_sre realm and then to users in the side bar on the left.
3. Create the new user by clicking on the add user button on the right-hand side
4. Give the user a user name and any other information you want to add. Make sure the user enabled slider is set to on.

5. Once you click save you will be able to give the user credentials. This is done by clicking the credentials tab and either giving them a temporary password which the user changes when they first login or a permanent password that can't be changed.

=== Giving the user permission in OSD data plane cluster
1. To give the users permission you will need ocm permissions, user.json and ocm post command which can be gotten from the SOP document in the on-boarding RTS doc

== Validate

1. Check that the users have been created using the ocm get command from the SOP doc.

2. Make sure the users can log in to the data plane cluster using the kafka_sre idp option

3. Ensure they have dedicated admin permissions in the cluster by checking the groups in the user management tab of the cluster


== Troubleshooting

If people are unable to login ensure the username specified in sso is the same as the one your giving permissions to in user.json
