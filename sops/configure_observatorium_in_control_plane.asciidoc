= Configure Observatorium credentials in the Control Plane

toc::[]

== Description

This SOP describes how to update credentials and configuration for the Observatorium instance the Control Plane (and indirectly, the Data Plane) should use.

== Prerequisites

1. Access to the vault secret where Observatoriums credentials are stored https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/managed-service-api/production/service/credentials
2. Ability to create merge requests against https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface

== Execute/Resolution


1. Create a merge request with updated values for the relevant parameters in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-services/cicd/saas/saas-kas-fleet-manager.yaml#L485-492
Known paramaters are DEX_URL, DEX_USERNAME, OBSERVATORIUM_GATEWAY & OBSERVATORIUM_TENANT.
2. Update secret vaules in vault if needed https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/managed-service-api/production/service/credentials Relevant secrets include `dex.secret`, `dex.password` and `observatorium.token`
3. Update the version in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/managed-services/namespaces/managed-services-production.yml#L40 to match the vault secret version an dcreate a new merge request.
4. Get the merge requests reviewed & merged

== Validate

1. Verify the values in the control plance are correct by comparing to the secrets in the control plane cluster. TODO
2. Verify data is being sent to Observatorium. TODO

== Troubleshooting
