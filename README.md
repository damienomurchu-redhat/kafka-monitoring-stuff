# kafka-monitoring-stuff

This repo has a set of Make targets for the installation and configuration of Kafka in OSD (using Strimzi), and various components to monitor Kafka.
It is intended as a place for hacking things together and dumping any useful stuff until itâ€™s found a more permanent home.

**Not for production use**

## Prerequisites

- A running OpenShift 4 cluster with kubeadmin access
- oc > 4.5 and kubectl > 1.18 binaries, logged in to the OpenShift 4 cluster
- jq installed
- (optional) The strimzi-operator is running in the cluster. Make targets exist to do this as well.
- (optional) A Kafka CR exists & has been reconciled into a running Kafka cluster. Make targets exist to do this as well.

## Terminology

- `in-cluster`, `on-cluster`, `cluster-wide` Refer to things in the same cluster as the Strimzi operator & all the Kafka CRs it's managing
- `global`, `central`, `centralised` Refer to things that are *not* in the same cluster as the Strimzi operator. Typically only 1 instance of these things.

## Installation Options

There are a number of installation options depending on how much of the stack is *already* running in your cluster, and how much you want to *get* running.
The options are available as separate `make` targets from the `install` folder.

```sh
cd install
```

### Installing observability operator

The Observability Operator install requires some variables to be set

|Variable | Use|
|------------|-------|
|OBSERVABILITY_RESOURCES_GH | Github URL for observability resources. Defaults to [observability-resources-mk](https://api.github.com/repos/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/observability-resources-mk/contents)|
|ACCESS_TOKEN | Github access token to pull observability resources |
|DEX_PASSWORD | Password for accessing dex|
|DEX_SECRET | Secret for accessing dex|
|DEX_USERNAME | Username for accessing dex |

The Observability stack requires a Personal Access Token to read externalized configuration from within the bf2 organization. For development cycles, you will need to generate a personal token for your own GitHub user (with bf2 access) and place the value in the ConfigMap.
To generate a new token:
* Follow the steps found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token), making sure to check ONLY the repo box at the top of the scopes/permissions list (which will check the 3 subcategory boxes beneath it).
* Copy the value of your Personal Access Token to a secure private location. Once you leave the page, you cannot access the value again & you will be forced to reset the token to receive a new value should you lose the original.
* Take care not to push your PAT to any repository as if you do, GitHub will automatically revoke your token as soon as you push and you'll need to follow this process again to generate a new token.

If you want to point to a local or non-default observatorium instance, edit the URL in your fork of the [resource file](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/observability-resources-mk/blob/main/development/index.json) and use the OBSERVABILITY_RESOURCES_GH variable to instatiate the operator with that config.

Once the make recipe has completed the observability operator and config is deployed in the *kafka-observability* namespace. 

### 1) Install *everything*

**Caution:** You probably don't want to do this. Consider installing just the in-cluster components or just the global components in a single cluster.

The following things will be installed:

* global monitoring components for centralised metrics
* observability operator
* strimzi operator
* strimzi monitoring components to hook into cluster-wide monitoring components
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make all
```

<h3>2) Install <em>global</em> components <em>only</em></h3>

The following things will be installed:

* global monitoring components for centralised metrics

```sh
make install/monitoring/global
```

### 3) Install *in-cluster* components *only*

The following things will be installed:

* observability operator catalogue source
* strimzi operator
* strimzi monitoring components to hook into cluster-wide monitoring components
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make install/strimzi/operator
make install/observability
make install/kafka/cr
```

### 4) Install *in-cluster* strimzi & kafka components *only* (no monitoring)

The following things will be installed:

* strimzi operator
* a kafka cluster

```sh
make install/strimzi/operator
make install/kafka/cr
```

### 5) Install *in-cluster* monitoring components *only*

This option is useful if you already have a cluster with the strimzi operator running & a Kafka CR.

The following things will be installed:

* observability operator


```sh
make install/observability
```

Once the makefile has completed install the observability-operator from Operatorhub.

### 6) Install *Observatorium*

You can install observatorium and it's components with:

```sh
make install/observatorium
```

and uninstall it with:

```sh
make uninstall/observatorium
```
Monitoring of observatorium itself is also included with observatorium. 

The following will be installed:
* Grafana
    * Dashboards
* Promtheus
    * Metrics from Thanos, Loki and Prometheus
    * Alerts
    
#### Pointing the on cluster monitoring stack to observatorium

You can point Prometheus remote write and Promtail to an existing Observatorium instance:

```sh
OBSERVATORIUM_APPS_URL=<e.g. apps-crc.testing> make setup/observatorium
```

This will automatically fetch tokens and update the Prometheus and Promtail configuration

#### Tenant tokens

A default tenant with the name `test` is created. To obtain a token for this tenant:

1) Get the route to the OIDC server:

```
DEX_ROUTE=$(oc get routes dex -ndex -ojsonpath={.spec.host})
```

2) Request a token:

```
curl --request POST \
              --url http://${DEX_ROUTE}/dex/token \
              --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
              --data grant_type=password \
              --data username=admin@example.com \
              --data password=password \
              --data client_id=test \
              --data client_secret=ZXhhbXBsZS1hcHAtc2VjcmV0 \
              --data scope="openid email" | sed 's/^{.*"id_token":[^"]*"\([^"]*\)".*}/\1/'
```

__NOTE__: Observatorium is currently not part of the `all` or `clean` targets.


## Uninstallation

```sh
make clean
```

__NOTE__: uninstalling the cluster prometheus namespace can take a few minutes

## Where's what?

The following namespaces are created:

* *kafka-operator*: contains the Strimzi operator
* *kafka-cluster*: contains the Kafka cluster
* *managed-services-monitoring-global*: contains the global monitoring stack including Grafana, Thanos Receiver and Thanos Querier
* *managed-services-monitoring-prometheus*: contains the on cluster Prometheus that scrapes Kafka metrics
* *managed-services-monitoring-grafana*: contains the on cluster Grafana instance
* *kafka-observability* contains the observability operator catalogue source
* *observatorium-monitoring* contains the monitoring stack to monitor observatorium itself

## Notes

* The Grafana instances are protected by the OpenShift OAuth proxy. Sign in using an OpenShift account with permission to `get` `namespaces`.
* To sign in to Grafana itself (once passed the proxy), use the credentials from the `grafana-admin-credentials` secret in `managed-services-monitoring-grafana` namespace. This is only required if you want to modify dashboards (temporary as dashboards are persisted in GrafanaDashboard CRs & cannot be saved from the Grafana UI)
